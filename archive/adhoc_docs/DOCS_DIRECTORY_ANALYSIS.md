   - Automated setup (./setup-all.sh)
   - Manual setup instructions
   - AI client configuration

   - Block IDs, names, use cases

**Analysis**: Redundant with minecraft_items_filtered.json (7,662 items)
- Very limited (only 17 blocks)
- Not comprehensive
- Duplicates data available via search_minecraft_item tool

## Redundancy Assessment

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Major Overlap

**Problem**: Two nearly identical setup guides

**COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md vs USER_ACTION_GUIDE.md**:
- 80% content overlap
- Both cover ./setup-all.sh (automated setup)
- Both cover manual setup
- Both cover AI client configuration
- Both list same prerequisites

**Recommendation**: **DELETE COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md**
- Keep USER_ACTION_GUIDE.md (more detailed, has troubleshooting)
- Single source of truth for setup
- Eliminate confusion

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Minor Redundancy

**Problem**: Small block reference file duplicates JSON data

**minecraft_blocks_essential.md**:
- Only 17 blocks (vs 7,662 in JSON)
- Redundant with minecraft_items_filtered.json
- Generated file, not essential

**Recommendation**: **DELETE minecraft_blocks_essential.md**
- Users can use search_minecraft_item tool instead
- Full data available in JSON
- Reduces maintenance burden

### ✅ KEEP

**MINECRAFT_SERVER_SETUP.md** (8.3KB):
- Detailed manual Minecraft server setup
- Referenced by USER_ACTION_GUIDE.md
- Useful for manual setup or troubleshooting
- **Keep**: Standalone reference value

**minecraft_architectural_patterns.md** (22KB):
- User-facing building guide
- Best practices for architecture
- **Keep**: Reference guide (just moved from context/)

**terrain_generation_guide.md** (13KB):
- User-facing terrain guide
- WorldEdit techniques
- **Keep**: Reference guide (just moved from context/)

**docs/README.md** (1.5KB):
- Navigation document
- **Keep** but **Update** to remove references to deleted files

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Delete COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md ✅
```bash
rm docs/COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```

**Reason**:
- 80% duplicate of USER_ACTION_GUIDE.md
- USER_ACTION_GUIDE.md is more comprehensive (has troubleshooting)
- Eliminates confusion about which guide to follow

### 2. Delete minecraft_blocks_essential.md ✅
```bash
rm docs/minecraft_blocks_essential.md
```

**Reason**:
- Only 17 blocks (tiny sample)
- Full data in minecraft_items_filtered.json (7,662 items)
- Redundant with search_minecraft_item tool
- Generated file, low value

### 3. Update docs/README.md ✅
- Remove reference to COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Update to point to USER_ACTION_GUIDE.md only
- Remove reference to minecraft_blocks_essential.md

### 4. Update main README.md (if needed) ✅
- Check if it references COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Update to USER_ACTION_GUIDE.md only
