# Adhoc Documentation (Gitignored)

**Purpose**: Temporary documentation generated during development chat sessions

**Status**: These files are gitignored and won't be committed to the repository

---

## What's In Here

This folder contains documentation created during AI-assisted development sessions:

- Audit reports
- Cleanup recommendations
- Session summaries
- Implementation notes
- Progress tracking documents

## Why Gitignored?

These are **local development artifacts**:
- ✅ Useful for developer reference
- ✅ Track what was done and why
- ❌ Not part of the official project documentation
- ❌ Don't need to be in version control
- ❌ Would clutter the repository

## Permanent Documentation

For official project documentation, see:
- **`README.md`** - Main project documentation
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Contribution guidelines
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Version history
- **`docs/`** - User guides and setup instructions
- **`dev_docs/`** - Developer documentation (committed to repo)

**Note**: This folder and its contents are automatically ignored by git (see `.gitignore`)
