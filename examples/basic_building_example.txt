# VibeCraft Example: Basic Building

This example shows how to build a simple stone house using WorldEdit commands.

## Step 1: Find Your Location

User: "Where am I?"

Agent uses: get_player_position()
Returns: X=100, Y=64, Z=200 (looking north)

## Step 2: Build the Floor

User: "Build a 10x10 oak plank floor at my position"

Agent:
1. Uses get_surface_level(x=100, z=200) → Y=64 (ground level)
2. Sets floor AT ground level (not elevated):
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos1 100,64,200")
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos2 109,64,209")
   - worldedit_region(command="set oak_planks")

Result: 10x10 floor flush with ground

## Step 3: Build the Walls

User: "Add stone brick walls, 5 blocks tall"

Agent:
1. Selects region starting at floor level:
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos1 100,64,200")
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos2 109,68,209")  # Y=64 to Y=68 (5 blocks)
2. Creates walls (hollow):
   - worldedit_region(command="walls stone_bricks")

Result: Stone walls sitting on floor, 5 blocks tall

## Step 4: Add a Ceiling

User: "Add an oak plank ceiling"

Agent:
1. Selects top level:
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos1 100,68,200")
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos2 109,68,209")
2. Places ceiling:
   - worldedit_region(command="set oak_planks")

Result: Enclosed room with ceiling at Y=68

## Step 5: Add Door and Windows

User: "Add a door on the south side and 2 windows on the east side"

Agent:
1. Door: Cuts opening in south wall
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos1 104,64,200")
   - worldedit_selection(command="pos2 105,65,200")  # 2 blocks tall, 2 wide
   - worldedit_region(command="set air")

2. Windows: Adds glass with frames
   - Cuts window openings
   - Places glass_pane
   - Adds smooth_stone frames around glass

Result: Functional house with entrance and natural light

## Key Principles Demonstrated

1. **Floor = Ground Level** - Floor at Y=64 (same as surrounding terrain)
2. **Walls Start at Floor** - Walls begin at Y=64, not Y=65
3. **Selection Order** - pos1 (corner 1) → pos2 (corner 2) → command
4. **Hollow Structures** - Use //walls instead of //set for rooms
5. **Layered Building** - Floor → walls → ceiling → details

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T**: Place floor at Y=65 (elevated)
✅ **DO**: Place floor at Y=64 (ground level)

❌ **DON'T**: Use //set for walls (fills interior)
✅ **DO**: Use //walls for hollow rooms

❌ **DON'T**: Forget to scan before furniture
✅ **DO**: Always use spatial_awareness_scan first

- Experiment with different materials and sizes
- Add a roof using [roofing patterns](../context/minecraft_architectural_patterns.md)
