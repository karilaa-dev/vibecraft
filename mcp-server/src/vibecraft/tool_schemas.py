This is the most flexible tool - it can execute ANY command supported by Minecraft or WorldEdit.
Use this for commands not covered by specialized tools, or when you need full control.

IMPORTANT - Command Syntax:
- WorldEdit commands: Use DOUBLE slash `//` (e.g., `//pos1`, `//set`, `//sphere`)
- Vanilla Minecraft commands: No slash needed (e.g., `list`, `time set day`)
- Coordinates: Comma-separated for WorldEdit (e.g., `//pos1 100,64,100`)
- World context: Automatically set for all WorldEdit commands

Examples:
- "list" - List players
- "time set day" - Set time to day
- "//pos1 100,64,100" - Set WorldEdit position 1
- "//set stone" - Fill selection with stone
- "//sphere oak_leaves 10" - Create sphere
- "//copy" - Copy selection to clipboard
- "//paste" - Paste clipboard

⚠️ Common Mistake:
- ❌ WRONG: "sphere oak_leaves 6" - Missing //
- ✅ CORRECT: "//sphere oak_leaves 6" - Has //

Safety: Commands are validated before execution. Dangerous commands are blocked by default.

            description="""WorldEdit Selection Commands - Define and manipulate the selected region.

Before performing operations on a region, you must define it by setting positions.
World context is automatically set for all WorldEdit commands from RCON.

Key Commands:
- /pos1 X,Y,Z - Set first corner (comma-separated!)
- /pos2 X,Y,Z - Set second corner (comma-separated!)
- /sel [mode] - Change selection mode (cuboid, extend, poly, ellipsoid, sphere, cyl, convex)
- /expand <amount> [direction] - Expand selection
- /expand vert - Expand selection vertically to world limits (Y=-64 to Y=319)
- /contract <amount> [direction] - Contract selection
- /inset <amount> - Inset selection (contract all faces equally)
- /outset <amount> - Outset selection (expand all faces equally)
- /shift <amount> [direction] - Shift selection
- /size - Get selection information
- /count <mask> - Count blocks matching mask

Example Workflow:
1. /pos1 100,64,100
2. /pos2 120,80,120
3. /size
4. Now you can use region commands like /set

Selection Modes:
- cuboid (default) - Standard box selection
- extend - Extend selection with each click
- poly - 2D polygon selection
- ellipsoid - Ellipsoid selection
- sphere - Spherical selection
- cyl - Cylindrical selection
- convex - Convex hull selection

Special:
- //expand vert - Extends selection from bedrock to build limit (full height)
- //inset 2 - Shrinks selection by 2 blocks on all sides
- //outset 3 - Expands selection by 3 blocks on all sides

Note: Always use comma-separated coordinates from console!

These commands operate on your current selection (set with //pos1 and //pos2).

Most Common Commands:
- //set <pattern> - Fill region with pattern
- //replace [from] <to> - Replace blocks in selection
- //replacenear <size> <from> <to> - Replace blocks in sphere around you (no selection needed!)
- //walls <pattern> - Build walls (sides only)
- //faces <pattern> - Build all 6 faces
- //overlay <pattern> - Overlay pattern on top surface
- //center <pattern> - Set center blocks
- //hollow [thickness] - Hollow out the region
- //line <pattern> [thickness] [-h] - Draw line (use -h for hollow)
- //curve <pattern> [thickness] [-h] - Draw curve (use -h for hollow)
- //smooth [iterations] - Smooth terrain elevation
- //naturalize - Create natural dirt/stone layers

Advanced Movement:
- //move [count] [direction] [replace] [-s] [-a] [-b] [-e] [-m <mask>]
  -s: Move without copying (cut)
  -a: Skip air blocks
  -b: Copy biomes
  -e: Copy entities
  -m: Source mask

- //stack [count] [direction] [-s] [-a] [-b] [-e] [-r] [-m <mask>]
  -s: Stack without original
  -a: Skip air blocks
  -b: Copy biomes
  -e: Copy entities
  -r: Move in reverse
  -m: Source mask

Pattern Examples:
- stone
- 50%stone,30%cobblestone,20%andesite
- ##wool (random wool colors)

Example Usage:
//set stone_bricks - Fill region with stone bricks
//walls oak_planks - Create wooden walls
//replace stone air - Remove all stone in selection
//replacenear 20 stone cobblestone - Replace stone with cobblestone within 20 blocks
//move 10 north -s - Cut and move 10 blocks north
//stack 5 up -a - Stack 5 times upward, skip air

Note: //replacenear is more intuitive for quick edits - no selection needed!

⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER teleport the player! Always use selection commands instead.

✅ World context is automatically set for all WorldEdit commands.

MANDATORY Workflow (NO teleportation):
1. Calculate target coordinates where you want to build
2. Calculate the selection region needed (see formulas below)
3. Set selection using worldedit_selection (pos1, pos2)
4. Run generation command

Selection Formulas:
- Sphere radius R at center (X,Y,Z):
  pos1: X-R, Y-R, Z-R
  pos2: X+R, Y+R, Z+R

- Cylinder radius R, height H at base (X,Y,Z):
  pos1: X-R, Y, Z-R
  pos2: X+R, Y+H-1, Z+R

- Pyramid size S at base (X,Y,Z):
  pos1: X-S, Y, Z-S
  pos2: X+S, Y+S, Z+S

Available Commands:
- sphere <pattern> <radius> [raised?] - Create filled sphere
- hsphere <pattern> <radius> [raised?] - Create hollow sphere
- pyramid <pattern> <size> - Create filled pyramid
- hpyramid <pattern> <size> - Create hollow pyramid
- cyl <pattern> <radius> [height] - Create cylinder
- hcyl <pattern> <radius> [height] - Create hollow cylinder

Example: Build 15-block pyramid at X=1242, Y=-60, Z=43
1. Calculate: pyramid size 15 needs region from -15 to +15 in X/Z
2. pos1 = (1242-15, -60, 43-15) = (1227, -60, 28)
3. pos2 = (1242+15, -60+15, 43+15) = (1257, -45, 58)
4. Commands:
   worldedit_selection(command="pos1 1227,-60,28")
   worldedit_selection(command="pos2 1257,-45,58")
   worldedit_generation(command="pyramid sandstone 15")

❌ WRONG: tp @p X Y Z → worldedit_generation(...)
✅ CORRECT: Calculate region → pos1 → pos2 → worldedit_generation(...)

Note: Patterns can be block names (stone, oak_wood) or complex patterns (50%stone,50%cobblestone).

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Brushes require player interaction (clicking). Most won't work from console/RCON.
However, you CAN configure brushes from console using the configuration commands below.

BRUSH CONFIGURATION (works from console):
- /mask <mask> - Set brush mask (which blocks to affect)
- /material <pattern> - Set brush material/pattern
- /size <size> - Set brush size/radius
- /range <range> - Set brush range (reach distance)
- /tracemask [mask] - Set trace mask (what stops ray-trace)
- // or /, - Toggle super pickaxe

BASIC BRUSHES (require player interaction):
- /br sphere <pattern> [radius] [-h] - Sphere brush (-h for hollow)
- /br cylinder <pattern> [radius] [height] [-h] - Cylinder brush
- /br smooth [radius] [iterations] [mask] - Terrain smoother
- /br gravity [radius] [-h <height>] - Gravity simulator
- /br clipboard [-a] [-v] [-o] [-e] [-b] [-m <mask>] - Clipboard brush
- /br snowsmooth [radius] [iterations] - Snow terrain smoother
- /br extinguish [radius] - Fire extinguisher
- /br butcher [radius] [-p] [-n] [-g] [-a] [-b] - Kill mobs brush
- /br splatter <pattern> [radius] [decay] - Splatter brush

ADVANCED BRUSH SYSTEMS (require player interaction):

/brush apply <shape> [radius] <type> <params>
  Applies operations in specific shapes (sphere, cylinder, cuboid)
  Types:
  - forest <tree_type> - Plant trees in shape
  - item <item> [direction] - Use item in shape
  - set <pattern> - Place blocks in shape

  Examples:
  /br apply sphere 10 forest oak
  /br apply cylinder 15 set stone_bricks
  /br apply cuboid 20 item bone_meal up

/brush paint <shape> [radius] [density] <type> <params>
  Paints operations with density control (0-100% coverage)
  Types:
  - forest <tree_type> - Paint trees with density
  - item <item> [direction] - Paint with item at density
  - set <pattern> - Paint blocks at density

  Examples:
  /br paint sphere 15 30 forest oak  (30% tree coverage)
  /br paint cylinder 12 50 set grass_block  (50% grass coverage)

BRUSH WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:
1. /br sphere stone 5 - Create stone sphere brush
2. /mask dirt,grass_block - Only affect dirt/grass
3. /size 10 - Change size to 10
4. Player right-clicks to use brush

For AI/programmatic building, use region or generation commands instead of brushes.

1. **search** - Find furniture by name, category, or tags
2. **get** - Retrieve complete layout data for a specific furniture piece by ID

Each layout includes:
- Precise block placements with coordinates
- Material requirements and counts
- Bounding box dimensions
- Clearance requirements
- Design notes and variants

Use this to:
- Browse available furniture options
- Get exact specifications for furniture building
- Check material requirements before building
- Find furniture that matches a specific style or category

Examples:
- search: {"action": "search", "query": "table"} - Find all table designs
- search: {"action": "search", "category": "bedroom"} - Find bedroom furniture
- search: {"action": "search", "tags": ["compact", "modern"]} - Find compact modern furniture
- get: {"action": "get", "furniture_id": "simple_dining_table"} - Get full layout for dining table

Inputs:
- `furniture_id` from furniture_lookup (must be a layout with automated coordinates)
- `origin_x`, `origin_y`, `origin_z` for the layout origin
- Optional `facing` override (north/east/south/west)
- `place_on_surface` (default: true) - If true, origin_y is treated as the FLOOR LEVEL
  and furniture is placed ON TOP (at origin_y + 1). If false, furniture is placed
  exactly at origin_y (may replace floor blocks).

IMPORTANT: When using get_surface_level, pass the returned Y directly as origin_y.
The furniture will automatically be placed on top of the surface. Example:
  surface_y = 64 (the floor block)
  place_furniture(origin_y=64, place_on_surface=true)  # Places furniture at Y=65 (on floor)

**🎯 WHEN TO USE**: Use this tool BEFORE placing ANY blocks to understand the spatial context.

**⚠️ MANDATORY FOR**:
- ✅ ALL furniture placement → Scan at furniture center BEFORE placing
- ✅ ALL roof construction → Scan each layer BEFORE placing stairs
- ✅ ALL interior walls → Scan to ensure ceiling height clearance
- ✅ ALL window placement → Scan to detect wall thickness and frame depth
- ✅ ANY block placement requiring alignment with existing structure

**WHY V2 IS BETTER**:
- 🚀 10-20x faster (2-10 seconds vs 30-60 seconds)
- 📊 MORE information (clearance, materials, structure type)
- 🎯 Better recommendations (style matching, placement guidance)
- ⚡ Uses WorldEdit bulk operations (not per-block queries)

**DETAIL LEVELS** (choose speed vs. information tradeoff):

**LOW** (~50 commands, 2-3 seconds):
- Floor/ceiling detection (Y coordinates)
- 3D voxel density map
- Basic material summary
- USE FOR: Quick checks before simple placements

**MEDIUM** (~100 commands, 4-5 seconds) - ⭐ RECOMMENDED:
- Everything in LOW +
- Clearance in 6 directions (north/south/east/west/up/down)
- Blocked direction detection
- USE FOR: Most furniture, wall, and structural placements

**HIGH** (~200 commands, 8-10 seconds):
- Everything in MEDIUM +
- Material palette detection (style matching)
- Structure pattern detection (roof/building/wall classification)
- Architectural style inference (medieval/modern/rustic)
- USE FOR: Complex builds, style-matching requirements, quality builds

**EXAMPLE WORKFLOWS**:

**Furniture Placement (MEDIUM detail)**:
```
1. spatial_awareness_scan(center_x=100, center_y=65, center_z=200, radius=5, detail_level="medium")
   → Returns: floor_placement_y=65, ceiling_placement_y=69, clearance in all directions
2. Verify clearance: north=5 blocks, east=3 blocks → Table will fit!
3. place_furniture(furniture_id="table", origin_x=100, origin_y=65, origin_z=200)
   → Perfect placement on floor with confirmed clearance!
```

**Roof Construction (LOW detail - fast repeated scans)**:
```
1. spatial_awareness_scan(center_x=100, center_y=72, center_z=105, radius=8, detail_level="low")
   → Returns: Detects existing structures at Y=71
2. Place stairs at Y=72 (offset from Y=71 layer)
3. Repeat scan at Y=73 for next layer
   → Fast enough to scan before each layer!
```

**Style-Matching Build (HIGH detail)**:
```
1. spatial_awareness_scan(center_x=100, center_y=65, center_z=200, radius=10, detail_level="high")
   → Returns: style="medieval", wood_type="oak", stone_type="stone_bricks"
2. Build new structure using oak_planks and stone_bricks to match
   → Cohesive architectural style!
```

**Performance Tips**:
- Use LOW for quick/repeated scans (roof layers, simple checks)
- Use MEDIUM for most placements (furniture, walls, interiors) - ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Use HIGH when you need style matching or detailed structure analysis
- Smaller radius = faster (radius 3-5 is usually sufficient)

**Performance Comparison by Detail Level**:
- LOW: ~50 commands, 2-3 seconds - Basic floor/ceiling detection
- MEDIUM: ~100 commands, 4-5 seconds - + clearance detection (⭐ RECOMMENDED)
- HIGH: ~200 commands, 8-10 seconds - + style matching & pattern recognition

**⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER**: ALWAYS scan before placing blocks that need alignment!

Creates natural-looking landscapes with pre-tested recipes for hills, mountains, valleys, plateaus, and ranges.

**Terrain Types**:
- **rolling_hills**: Gentle undulating hills (Perlin noise)
- **rugged_mountains**: Sharp peaks and ridges (Ridged Multifractal)
- **valley_network**: Interconnected valleys for rivers (Inverted Perlin)
- **mountain_range**: Linear mountain chain in a direction (Oriented Ridged)
- **plateau**: Flat-topped elevation with rough edges

**Process**:
1. Sets WorldEdit selection
2. Applies noise-based deformation
3. Smooths terrain for natural appearance
4. Returns summary with parameters used

**Safety**: Amplitude capped at 50 blocks, region size limited

**Use Cases**:
- Create backdrop for castle/fortress
- Generate farmland with gentle slopes
- Add river valley systems
- Build continental divide features
- Make dramatic mesa formations

**Examples**:
- Gentle hills: generate_terrain(type="rolling_hills", x1=0, y1=64, z1=0, x2=100, y2=80, z2=100, scale=18, amplitude=6)
- Mountains: generate_terrain(type="rugged_mountains", x1=0, y1=64, z1=0, x2=100, y2=100, z2=100, scale=28, amplitude=18)
- Valleys: generate_terrain(type="valley_network", x1=0, y1=64, z1=0, x2=100, y2=80, z2=100, scale=22, depth=10)
- Range: generate_terrain(type="mountain_range", x1=0, y1=64, z1=0, x2=200, y2=100, z2=100, direction="north-south", amplitude=20)

Replaces base blocks and overlays surface patterns to create realistic-looking landscapes.

**Texturing Styles**:
- **temperate**: Grass, moss, dirt (plains/forest biomes)
- **alpine**: Stone, snow, gravel (high altitude)
- **desert**: Sand, sandstone, terracotta (arid regions)
- **volcanic**: Basalt, magma, blackstone (lava zones)
- **jungle**: Rich soil, podzol, moss (tropical)
- **swamp**: Mud, clay, damp grass (wetlands)

**Process**:
1. Sets WorldEdit selection
2. Replaces bulk material (stone → style-appropriate base)
3. Overlays surface pattern (grass/snow/sand on top)
4. Returns confirmation

**When to Use**:
- AFTER terrain shaping (hills, mountains, etc.)
- To convert raw stone terrain to natural-looking landscape
- To theme an area for specific biome
- For visual cohesion across large regions

Applies WorldEdit smoothing algorithm to blend block heights naturally.

**Use Cases**:
- Post-processing after terrain generation
- Fixing blocky noise artifacts
- Creating gentle transitions between elevations
- Reducing harsh cliffs to natural slopes

**Parameters**:
- iterations: More passes = smoother (2-4 recommended)
- Less smoothing preserves sharp features (mountains)
- More smoothing creates gentler slopes (hills)

**Best Practices**:
- Always smooth after //deform operations
- Use 1-2 iterations for mountains (preserve peaks)
- Use 3-4 iterations for rolling hills (gentle)
- Can apply mask to smooth only certain blocks

**Examples**:
- Light smoothing: smooth_terrain(x1=0, y1=64, z1=0, x2=100, y2=80, z2=100, iterations=2)
- Heavy smoothing: smooth_terrain(x1=0, y1=64, z1=0, x2=100, y2=80, z2=100, iterations=4)

Building templates are reusable,  parametric designs for common structures (towers, houses, barns, etc.) that can be customized with user preferences.

**Available Templates** (5 templates):
1. **medieval_round_tower** (intermediate) - Circular stone tower with spiral stairs, arrow slits, crenellations
2. **simple_cottage** (beginner) - Cozy rectangular cottage with gabled roof, chimney
3. **guard_tower** (beginner) - Square defensive tower with observation platform
4. **wizard_tower** (intermediate) - Mystical tower with purple accents, glowing lights, cone roof
5. **simple_barn** (beginner) - Rustic wooden barn with large doors and hayloft

**Actions**:
- **list** - List all available templates with brief descriptions
- **search** - Find templates by category, difficulty, or style tags
- **get** - Retrieve full template with parameters and build instructions
- **customize** - Show customization options for a template

**Template Benefits**:
- ⚡ 10x faster than building from scratch
- ✅ Consistent, professional quality
- 🎨 Fully customizable (height, size, materials, style)
- 📐 Pre-calculated dimensions and proportions
- 🏗️ Step-by-step build sequence

**Usage Workflow**:
1. Search or list templates: `building_template(action="list")` or `building_template(action="search", category="towers")`
2. Get template details: `building_template(action="get", template_id="medieval_round_tower")`
3. Customize parameters (height, radius, materials, etc.) based on user preferences
4. Follow build_sequence to construct using WorldEdit commands
5. Each component provides specific commands with parameter substitution

**Example**:
building_template(action="get", template_id="simple_cottage")
→ Returns cottage template with parameters: width (7-15, default 9), depth (7-15, default 11), materials, etc.
→ User: "Make it 11×13 with stone walls"
→ Agent customizes: width=11, depth=13, wall_material="cobblestone"
→ Agent follows build_sequence: foundation → walls → floor → door → windows → roof → chimney
→ Result: Custom cottage in ~60 seconds

**Customization**:
Templates support parameters like:
- Dimensions: height, width, depth, radius (integer ranges with min/max)
- Materials: wall_material, roof_material, floor_material (enum with options)
- Features: has_windows, has_chimney, roof_style (boolean or enum)
- Complexity: num_floors, size (affects build scope)

**Categories**: towers, houses, agricultural, defensive, decorative, industrial, fantasy, religious
**Difficulty Levels**: beginner, intermediate, advanced

**⚠️ POWERFUL COMMAND - Use with caution!**

The //deform command uses mathematical expressions to deform terrain in the current selection.
Variables available: x, y, z (current coordinates), and you reassign them to move blocks.

**Common Deformations**:

**Sine wave terrain**:
```
//deform y-=0.2*sin(x*5)
```
Creates wavy terrain with amplitude 0.2 and frequency 5.

**Radial stretch**:
```
//deform x*=1.5;z*=1.5
```
Stretches selection outward from center.

**Twist effect**:
```
//deform x-=0.3*sin(y*5);z-=0.3*cos(y*5)
```
Twists terrain vertically.

**Sphere/dome**:
```
//deform y+=sqrt(64-(x^2+z^2))
```
Creates domed/spherical deformation.

**Safety Notes**:
- Always test on small selections first
- Use //undo if result is unexpected
- Expressions execute per-block (expensive on large areas)
- Check coordinates carefully (x, y, z syntax)

**Examples**:
- deform: {"expression": "y-=0.2*sin(x*5)"} - Wavy terrain
- deform: {"expression": "x*=1.2;z*=1.2"} - Radial expansion
- deform: {"expression": "y+=0.5*cos(x)*sin(z)"} - Organic bumps

- Density: 0-100 (default 10)
- Places grass, flowers, mushrooms, dead bushes based on biome
- Respects existing terrain (only places on valid blocks)

- Types: oak, birch, spruce, jungle, acacia, dark_oak, random
- Density: 0-100 (default 5)
- Automatically spaces trees naturally
- Respects terrain height
- Example: forest(type="oak", density=10) for oak forest

- Types: oak, birch, spruce, jungle, acacia, dark_oak, random
- Size: small, medium, large (varies by tree type)
- Example: tool_tree(type="oak", size="medium")

**Best Practices**:
- Start with low density (5-10) and increase if needed
- Use //flora for undergrowth, //forest for trees
- Combine both for realistic forests
- Use selection to limit vegetation to specific areas

**Examples**:
- flora: {"density": 15} - Moderate flora coverage
- forest: {"type": "oak", "density": 7} - Oak forest
- forest: {"type": "random", "density": 10} - Mixed forest
- tool_tree: {"type": "spruce", "size": "large"} - Large spruce placer
